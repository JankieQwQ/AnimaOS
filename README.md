# AnimaOS

*AnimaOS is an open user operating system.*

AnimaOS aims to build a computing cluster by sharing the computing power of users, enabling equitable sharing of computing resources.

## Feature

- **Shared Computing Power** : AnimaOS allows users to contribute the idle computing power of their computing devices to the cluster for use by other users. This mechanism of sharing computing power can maximize the utilization of computing resources and improve the computing efficiency of the entire system.
- **Fair distribution** : In AnimaOS, all users' contributions to the cluster are treated equally, and each user enjoys the same computing power. This fair distribution ensures fairness and equality among users.
- **Open Source** : AnimaOS is developed based on Javascript and released as open source. This means that anyone can view, modify, and contribute to the code, which drives the continuous development and improvement of the system.
